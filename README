THIS WILL NOT BUILD ON MCGILL SERVERS. THERE IS A DEPENDENCY ON LLVM(3.4) WHICH IS NOT INSTALLED ON THE MACHINES.


To build this project run the command 
  cabal sandbox init
  cabal install --upgrade-dependencies --constraint="template-haskell installed" --dependencies-only
  cabal build

To build a file, from the main directory run:
 cabal run -- file.go
 gcc file.s

This will produce an executable, either the default a.out or if the -o option is specified, whatever output was desired.

Simply run the final exectuable for the desired results.
 
This will build the binary in `dist/mgc/mgc`
